            <p>With over a <b>decade of experience</b> in business development, account and sales management, and customer service, I’ve honed my skills across multiple industries and roles. My work has involved not only managing teams and leading sales strategies but also handling administrative duties, recruitment, and appointment setting, allowing me to gain a well-rounded perspective on organizational operations. I am highly skilled in using Microsoft Excel, Word, and PowerPoint to streamline processes and improve efficiency in day-to-day tasks.</p>
            <P>I pride myself on my problem-solving abilities and my capacity to <b>thrive under pressure</b>, with a <b>strong commitment</b> to delivering results. Over the years, I’ve been recognized for my contributions, including receiving the Best of the Best Business Investigations Agent awards in both May and November 2014. My role as a Top Sales Consultant in August 2018 and Account Manager of the Month in December 2019 highlights my consistent performance in achieving sales goals and maintaining client satisfaction.</P>
            <P>My work experience spans from managing personal injury cases as a Case Manager to working as a Sales and Account Manager for several companies. These roles have provided me with the <b>opportunity to develop</b> strong client relationships, negotiate deals, and manage high-value accounts. I’ve consistently been able to exceed targets, as reflected in my achievements as the Top Sales Manager from August 2020 until March 2023.</P>
            <p>Beyond the technical skills and professional accolades, what drives me is a <b>passion for building</b> meaningful relationships and creating solutions that meet both client and business needs. I believe in continuously learning and improving, and I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to apply my expertise in fresh, impactful ways.</p>
